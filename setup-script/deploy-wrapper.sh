#!/bin/bash
# deploy-wrapper.sh — safely sync ONE src/wrappers/* file to a live Pi's
# /opt/demiurge/bin/, without silently clobbering a Pi-side fix that never
# made it back into the repo (this is what caused src/wrappers/demiurge-run-csound
# to drift out of sync with the deployed copy — see git log on that file).
#
# Run from your Mac (or any machine with SSH access):
#   ./setup-script/deploy-wrapper.sh <wrapper-filename> [user@host]
#
# Examples:
#   ./setup-script/deploy-wrapper.sh demiurge-run-csound
#   ./setup-script/deploy-wrapper.sh demiurge-run-nam <user>@<host>   # override pi-rig.conf
#
# What this does:
#   1. Confirms the named file exists locally under src/wrappers/.
#   2. Diffs the local repo copy against the DEPLOYED copy on the Pi and
#      prints the diff — you must look at this before it installs anything.
#      If there is no difference, it says so and exits (nothing to do).
#   3. Prompts for confirmation before touching the Pi.
#   4. Stages the file via /tmp on the Pi, then installs it with
#      `sudo install -m0755` (same pattern used by deploy-nam.sh and
#      deploy-rnbo-wave1.sh for wrapper installs).
#   5. Reminds you to restart demiurge.service afterward — it does NOT do
#      this automatically, since a wrapper swap while a session is running
#      is disruptive and should be a deliberate, separate step.
#
# This script does nothing unless a human runs it. It is not invoked by
# setup-demiurge.sh or any other automated path.
