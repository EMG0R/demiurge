#
# Installs the prebuilt arm64 rnbooscquery runner, but neutralises every
# stock service so NOTHING auto-starts, grabs the audio device, spawns a
# jackd, or auto-updates. DEMIURGE will run the runner itself later, under
# its own pipewire-jack env. Requires Step 1 (rnbo-add-repo.sh) done first.
#
# Run as root on the Pi:
#   sudo bash rnbo-install-runner.sh
#
# UNDO:
#   sudo apt-mark unhold rnbooscquery rnbo-update-service rnbo-runner-panel
#   sudo apt-get remove --purge -y rnbooscquery rnbo-update-service rnbo-runner-panel
#   sudo systemctl unmask rnbooscquery rnbo-runner-panel rnbo-update-service
#
# Not `set -e`: we want to install, then REPORT state even if a package
# post-install step trips over a masked unit (which is expected/harmless).
