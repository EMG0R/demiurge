# systemd unit this script installs (demiurge.service, demiurge-touch.service,
# demiurge-touch-poll.service, demiurge-web.service, rnbo-runner.service) has
# its User=/Group=/HOME= templated FROM this one variable, so renaming the rig
# (e.g. pi -> pi) needs no edits anywhere: just run this script
# logged in as the new user and it picks it up automatically. Override only if
# you're installing AS a different account than the one that will run the
# instrument (rare): PI_USER=someoneelse ./setup-demiurge.sh

#
# demiurge.local is the hostname set in Raspberry Pi Imager — substitute your
# own host below if yours differs (ssh <pi-user>@demiurge.local is just the
# example this script's comments were written against).
#
# Usage: ssh <pi-user>@demiurge.local ./setup-demiurge.sh
#        ssh <pi-user>@demiurge.local ./setup-demiurge.sh 4    # resume from phase 4
#        ssh <pi-user>@demiurge.local ./setup-demiurge.sh 8    # boot config + reboot only

# RNBO (Cycling '74) support is Phase 10 — part of the standard run, no
# separate opt-in step anymore. It adds Cycling '74's apt repo (informational
# check only, nothing installed from it) and builds rnbo.oscquery.runner
# FROM SOURCE with on-device compile enabled, since the prebuilt apt package
# ships that disabled. Expect Phase 10 to take a while on a first run (a real
# compile of the runner + its conan dependencies) — see
# setup-script/rnbo-build-runner.sh for the researched details. See
# demiurge/docs/rnbo.md for why the installed service is gated fail-closed:
# rnbo-runner.service only actually runs when live.conf has `rnbo = on`
# or a *.rnbo file is in the chain.

# hardware onto the shared bus). The REMOVE case was added alongside
# device-presence clock-role auto-switching (see
# src/demiurge-launcher-rs/src/clockrole.rs and
# demiurge/docs/clock-role-auto.md): a Pocket OpGorator/Daisy connected
# MIDI-only (no audio interface) generates no PipeWire audio-node event
# at all, so pw-mon (events::spawn_pwmon, which only watches
# alsa_output.*/alsa_input.* nodes) never fires on it either way — ADD
# or REMOVE. Re-running the connect script on REMOVE is a harmless,
# idempotent no-op (aconnect against a vanished client just fails
# silently, same as any other race this script already tolerates), so
# it costs nothing and keeps both actions symmetric.
#
# The actual role-tracking fix for the MIDI-only case is NOT this udev
# rule, though — the launcher process doesn't subscribe to udev events
# at all. It's clockrole::pmor_present() being polled every heartbeat
# (~2s) regardless of what triggered the tick, checking BOTH the
# PipeWire audio-node graph and devices::scan_usb_midi()'s ALSA-seq
# client list. That poll is what actually catches a MIDI-only device
# appearing or disappearing; this udev rule is a companion/symmetry fix
# for demiurge-midi-connect.sh's own job (bus wiring), not the presence
# oracle. Fail-safe by construction: a missing/renamed device just means
# aconnect has nothing to do, never a hang, so this cannot wedge the

# ---- LINGER: the single most important line in this script -----------------
# Without it the user systemd manager (and therefore PipeWire + WirePlumber)
# only exists while someone is LOGGED IN. On a headless instrument that means:
# PipeWire comes up when you ssh in, and DIES when you log out -- taking the
# interface's PipeWire node with it, which suspends the graph and kills csound.
#
# Diagnosed 2026-10-02 after hours of chasing symptoms: the journal showed two
# different `systemd --user` PIDs stopping/starting wireplumber, and
# `loginctl show-user` said `Linger=no`. It is why fixes appeared to work and
# then "stopped working", why restarting PipeWire helped only sometimes (the
# ssh login itself was what started it), and why the rig could never have run
# unattended. sync_layer = on CANNOT work without this, because that mode
# routes the chain through PipeWire nodes.
# ---- NEPTR UI python env ---------------------------------------------------
# pygame MUST come from apt, not pip. The pip wheel bundles its OWN SDL2 built
# WITHOUT the kmsdrm backend (SDL 2.28.4), so `pygame.display.init()` dies with
# "kmsdrm not available" on a headless KMS panel -- which is exactly how the UI
# failed for an hour on 2026-10-02 while it looked like a display-contention or
# DRM-master problem. Debian's python3-pygame links the SYSTEM SDL (2.32.4),
# which HAS kmsdrm. So: apt for pygame, --system-site-packages so the venv can

# ── Phase 7f: NEPTR VIDEO + HOME mode selector + arcade console ───────────

# at all, and demiurge-arcade.service had NEVER had an installer anywhere —
# games-install.sh explicitly deferred it, "install a user service later").

# does not build it — that's NEPTR_VIDEO/deploy/deploy-video.sh's job, run
# from the Mac (it rsyncs source + cmake builds + runs ctest). This phase:
#   1. installs the apt build deps deploy-video.sh needs, so that script can
#      ever succeed here
#   2. installs + enables neptr-video.service IF the binary already exists
#      (i.e. deploy-video.sh has been run at least once) — templated for
#      PI_USER like every other unit in this script
#   3. installs the arcade's build deps + uinput/groups/sudoers (the part of
#      demiurge/games/bin/games-install.sh that is host setup, not source
#      deploy) and installs + enables demiurge-arcade.service, templated
#
# BOOT ARBITRATION: neptr-video.service becomes the thing WantedBy=multi-user
# at boot (it boots into HOME, NEPTR's mode selector — AUDIO/VIDEO/GAMES).
# neptr-ui.service must stay DISABLED (not masked -- HOME starts it on demand
# via deploy/mode-audio.sh) or the two race for drmSetMaster at boot. This
# script does not touch demiurge.service's own enablement -- the audio ENGINE
# (csound etc., no display) keeps autostarting either way, only the FACE UI
# arbitration changes. See NEPTR_VIDEO/deploy/README.md section "One display,

#
# Installs three backends so they can be compared / used interchangeably, plus
# git + gh so an agent on the Pi can actually commit and push its own work, and
# tmux so a long investigation survives the SSH connection dropping.
